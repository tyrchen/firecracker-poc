# Firecracker POC - Active Context

## Current Phase
**Mode**: BUILD (Implementation) - Phase 5 Testing
**Stage**: Firecracker Environment Setup
**Focus**: Resolving Firecracker installation and testing end-to-end functionality

## Immediate Context
- **Project Type**: Rust-based web service for secure code execution
- **Architecture**: Axum web server + Firecracker microVM integration
- **Target**: Single `/execute` API endpoint for Python code execution
- **Security Model**: Complete isolation per execution via fresh microVMs

## Current Issue & Resolution
**Problem**: Firecracker binary not available on macOS host environment
- Error: "Code execution failed: Process spawn error: Failed to start Firecracker: Exec format error (os error 8)"
- Root cause: Running on macOS instead of Linux environment

**Solution**: Lima VM environment setup
- Lima VM `firecracker-vm` is running and configured
- Created `setup_firecracker.sh` script to install Firecracker in Lima VM
- Created `test_api.sh` script for comprehensive API testing

## Active Work Stream
1. **Memory Bank Initialization** âœ…
   - Created `.cursor/memory/` structure
   - Established core documentation files
   - Defined project scope and requirements

2. **Core Data Structures** âœ…
   - Implemented ExecuteRequest and ExecuteResponse structs
   - Created comprehensive ExecutionError enum
   - Added UUID support for VM identification
   - Built helper functions and comprehensive tests

3. **Firecracker Integration Module** âœ…
   - Created runner.rs module with complete VM lifecycle management
   - Implemented VMManager with async operations and timeout handling
   - Added comprehensive VM configuration via HTTP API
   - Built code execution with stdin injection and output capture
   - Added resource cleanup with process termination and socket removal
   - Created 4 unit tests covering all VM manager functionality

4. **Web Service Implementation** âœ…
   - Created main.rs with complete axum web server (212 lines)
   - Implemented /execute POST endpoint with comprehensive error handling
   - Added /health endpoint for service monitoring
   - Built JSON request/response handling with input validation
   - Added HTTP middleware with structured logging and tracing
   - Created 6 unit tests covering all endpoint scenarios
   - Integrated successfully with Firecracker runner module

5. **Environment Setup & Testing** ðŸ”„
   - Identified Firecracker availability issue on macOS
   - Created automated installation script for Linux environment
   - Set up Lima VM configuration for proper Linux testing environment
   - Created comprehensive test suite for API validation

## Required Environment Setup

### Lima VM Configuration
- VM: `firecracker-vm` (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
- Resources: 4 CPUs, 8GiB RAM, 50GiB disk
- Mount: Project directory at `~/projects/mycode/rust/firecracker-poc`

### Setup Instructions
1. Ensure Lima VM is running: `limactl list` should show `firecracker-vm` as Running
2. Shell into VM: `limactl shell firecracker-vm`
3. Navigate to project: `cd /Users/tchen/projects/mycode/rust/firecracker-poc`
4. Run setup script: `./setup_firecracker.sh`
5. Test API: `./test_api.sh` (in separate terminal)

## Key Technical Decisions Made
- **Web Framework**: `axum` (modern, tokio-integrated)
- **VM Management**: Direct firecracker subprocess control
- **Communication**: HTTP API via Unix socket
- **Isolation**: Fresh VM per request (no pooling in POC)
- **Language Support**: Python only for POC
- **Development Environment**: Lima VM for Linux compatibility

## Current Dependencies Status
```toml
[dependencies]
axum = "0.8"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
reqwest = { version = "0.12", default-features = false, features = ["json", "rustls-tls"] }
uuid = { version = "1", features = ["v4"] }
tower = { version = "0.5", features = ["util"] }
tower-http = { version = "0.6", features = ["trace"] }
tracing = "0.1"
tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3", features = ["env-filter"] }
```

## Critical Success Factors
- VM lifecycle management (spawn â†’ configure â†’ execute â†’ cleanup)
- Proper error handling and resource cleanup
- Secure process isolation
- Reliable stdout/stderr capture
- **Firecracker binary availability in Linux environment**

## Current Blockers
- **User needs to run setup script in Lima VM**

## Environment Requirements
- Firecracker binary (installed by setup script)
- Linux kernel image: `./hello-vmlinux.bin` âœ…
- Root filesystem: `./alpine-python.ext4` âœ…
- Write permissions for socket creation in `/tmp/`

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for data structures âœ…
- Integration tests for VM lifecycle âœ…
- End-to-end API testing with curl (setup_firecracker.sh + test_api.sh)
- Resource cleanup verification

## Next Session Focus
**Priority 1**: Run setup script in Lima VM to install Firecracker
**Priority 2**: Complete end-to-end testing with test script
**Priority 3**: Validate all success criteria and complete POC demonstration

## Setup Scripts Created
- `setup_firecracker.sh`: Downloads and installs Firecracker v1.7.0 for current architecture
- `test_api.sh`: Comprehensive API testing suite for validation
